94,Explain the concept of object-oriented programming and provide an example of how inheritance is used in Python.,"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of procedures (methods). In OOP, objects can interact with each other to perform tasks. Inheritance is a key feature of OOP that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This promotes code reusability and enables the creation of a hierarchical class structure. An example of inheritance in Python is shown below:

# Define a parent class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
