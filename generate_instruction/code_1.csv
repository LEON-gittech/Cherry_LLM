Example:

int[] arr = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
int min = Arrays.stream(arr).min().getAsInt();

System.out.println(min);

5. Calculate the middle index as (low + high) // 2.
6. Check if the middle element is equal to the target value. If so, return the index.
7. If the middle element is greater than the target value, update 'high' to mid - 1.
8. If the middle element is less than the target value, update 'low' to mid + 1.

Create a new virtual environment with the command 'virtualenv env' or 'python -m venv env' where 'env' is the name of your virtual environment. 5. Activate the virtual environment using 'source env/bin/activate' on Mac/Linux or '.inenvinenv.exe' on Windows. 6. You will see the name of the virtual environment in your command prompt or terminal, indicating that you are now working within the virtual environment. You can now install dependencies and work on your Python project in this isolated environment.",code
Create a Python script that reads a text file and counts the occurrences of each word. Display the word count in descending order.,"Creating a Python script to read a text file and count the occurrences of each word can be achieved with the following code:

```python
# Read the text file
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()

# Split the text into words
words = data.split()

# Count occurrences of each word
word_count = {}
for word in words:
    word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1

# Display word count in descending order
for word, count in sorted(word_count.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
    print(f'{word}: {count}')
```",code
Explain the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming with a code example in Java.,"Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming where a class (subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). This allows for code reusability and allows subclasses to extend or modify the behavior of the superclass. Here is an example of inheritance in Java:

// Superclass
public class Animal {
    String sound;

    public Animal(String sound) {
        this.sound = sound;
    }

    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(sound);
    }
}

// Subclass
public class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog() {
        super(""Woof"");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.makeSound(); // Output: Woof
    }
}",code
