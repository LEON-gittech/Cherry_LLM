Example:

int[] arr = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
int min = Arrays.stream(arr).min().getAsInt();

System.out.println(min);

The most common time complexities are O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and so on.\nFor example, consider a simple algorithm to find an element in an array: you start by checking if it's at index 0, then 1, then 2, and so on until you find it or reach the end of the array.\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.
