Explain the difference between recursion and iteration in programming and provide an example of each in a language of your choice.,"Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. Recursion typically involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems until a base case is reached. Iteration, on the other hand, is a loop-based approach where a set of instructions is repeated until a certain condition is met. Recursion can be more elegant and easier to implement for certain problems, while iteration is usually more efficient in terms of performance. Here is an example of recursion and iteration in Python:

Recursion Example:

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

result = factorial(5)
print(result)
```

Iteration Example:

```

        result *= i
    return result

result = factorial(5)
