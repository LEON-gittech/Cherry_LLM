Compare and contrast  two sorting algorithms: Bubble sort and Quick sort.,"Bubble sort is an algorithm that compares adjacent elements and swaps positions if they are out of order. It continues in this manner with loops until all elements of the array are in their correct order. Quick sort is very similar in its approach, but chooses a ""pivot"" element and divides the remaining array into two parts based on whether the elements are less than or greater than the pivot element. Bubble sort is simpler but has worse time complexity than Quick sort, which is more efficient.",

This is done by maintaining a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes that need to be visited. BFS ensures that all nodes at the same level are visited before moving on to the next level, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. The algorithm is commonly implemented iteratively using a queue and is known for its simplicity and efficiency in finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.",code

Summarize the concept of object-oriented programming and provide an example in Java programming language.,"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes data and methods into objects. Objects can communicate with each other through methods and inheritance allows new objects to take on properties of existing objects. Encapsulation ensures that data is kept private within an object. Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. In Java, classes are used to implement OOP concepts. Here's an example in Java:

Create a function in Python that takes a list as input and returns a new list with only the unique elements of the input list.,"To create a function in Python that takes a list as input and returns a new list with only the unique elements of the input list, you can use the following code snippet:
def unique_elements(input_list):
    return list(set(input_list))

# Example usage:
input_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
output_list = unique_elements(input_list)
print(output_list)",code
Write a Python function to count the number of occurrences of each word in a given text string.,"Here is a Python function that counts the number of occurrences of each word in a given text string:

```python
import re
from collections import Counter

def count_word_occurrences(text):
    words = re.findall(r'\w+', text.lower())
    word_counts = Counter(words)
    return word_counts

# Example usage
text = 'hello world hello'
result = count_word_occurrences(text)
print(result)
```
",code
Implement a function in Python that converts a list of strings to lowercase.,"def convert_to_lowercase(mylist):
  new_list = []
  
  for item in mylist:
    new_list.append(item.lower())
  
  return new_list

#Example usage:
mylist = [""This"", ""Is"", ""A"", ""List""]
print(convert_to_lowercase(mylist))

#Output:
['this', 'is', 'a', 'list']",code
Write a Python function named 'merge_sort' that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the list sorted in ascending order using the merge sort algorithm.,"def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    def merge(left, right):
        result = []
        i = j = 0
        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] < right[j]:
                result.append(left[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                result.append(right[j])
                j += 1
        result.extend(left[i:])
        result.extend(right[j:])
        return result

    middle = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:middle])
    right = merge_sort(arr[middle:])

    return merge(left, right)

# Example usage:
# unsorted_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
# sorted_list = merge_sort(unsorted_list)
# print(sorted_list)",code
Implement a function in Python that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.,"def reverse_string(input_string):
    return input_string[::-1]",code
Write a Python script to download a file from a given URL and save it locally.,"import urllib.request

url = 'http://www.example.com/file.txt'
file_name = 'file.txt'

urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, file_name)",code
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd numbers in the list.,"def sum_odd_numbers(input_list):
    sum_odd = 0
    for num in input_list:
        if num % 2 != 0:
            sum_odd += num
    return sum_odd",code
