Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 3: 3(x + 2y - z) = 3(5) => 3x + 6y - 3z = 15

Step 2: Add the modified first equation to the second equation: 3x + 6y - 3z + 3x - 6y + 3z = 15 + 9 => 6x = 24 => x = 4

Step 3: Substitute x = 4 back into the first equation: 4 + 2y - z = 5 => 2y - z = 1

Step 4: Multiply the first equation by 2: 2(2x + 4y - 2z) = 2(10) => 4x + 8y - 4z = 20

Step 5: Subtract the modified first equation from the last equation: 4x + 8y - 4z - 4 + 2y - z = 20 - 5 => 8y + 3z = 15

Step 6: Substitute x = 4 and 2y - z = 1 into the equation 8y + 3z = 15: 8y + 3(2y - 1) = 15 => 8y + 6y - 3 = 15 => 14y = 18 => y = 18/14 = 9/7

Step 7: Substitute y = 9/7 back into 2y - z = 1: 2(9/7) - z = 1 => 18/7 - z = 1 => z = 18/7 - 1 = 18/7 - 7/7 = 11/7

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 4, y = 9/7, z = 11/7.",math

Calculate the average speed of the car for the whole journey.,"To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x - 4, we first need to find the second derivative of the function and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.

First, let's find the first derivative of f(x):

f'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x - 4)
f'(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12

Now, let's find the second derivative of f(x):

f''(x) = d/dx (6x^2 - 18x + 12)
f''(x) = 12x - 18

To find the inflection points, we need to set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for x:

12x - 18 = 0
12x = 18
x = 18/12
x = 3/2

So, there is one inflection point at x = 3/2. To find the corresponding y-value, we plug this value back into the original function:

f(3/2) = 2(3/2)^3 - 9(3/2)^2 + 12(3/2) - 4
f(3/2) = 2(27/8) - 9(9/4) + 18 - 4
f(3/2) = 27/4 - 81/4 + 14
f(3/2) = -54/4 + 14
f(3/2) = -27/2 + 14
f(3/2) = -1/2

Thus, the inflection point is at (3/2, -1/2).",math

The cost of the superfruit juice cocktail is the weighted average of the mixed fruit juice and acai berry juice.
Let the required amount of acai berry juice to be added be x litres.
Total cost for the mixed fruit juice = $262.85 * 37 = $9720.45

For order 1, each line segment of the order 0 fractal is replaced by a smaller copy of the entire fractal. Since there are 4 line segments in the order 0 fractal, and each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller line segments, there are 4 * 4 = 16 line segments in the order 1 fractal. For order 2, each line segment of the order 1 fractal is replaced by a smaller copy of the entire fractal. Since there are 16 line segments in the order 1 fractal, and each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller line segments, there are 16 * 4 = 64 line segments in the order 2 fractal. For order 3, each line segment of the order 2 fractal is replaced by a smaller copy of the entire fractal.

According to the given information, we can create the following equations: a + b = 45, b + c = 55, and c + 3a = 90. From the first equation, we can solve for a in terms of b: a = 45 - b. Substituting this into the third equation, we get c + 3(45 - b) = 90, which simplifies to c + 135 - 3b = 90. Rearranging terms, we get c = 3b - 45. Now substituting this into the second equation b + (3b - 45) = 55, we can solve for b: 4b = 100, b = 25. Substituting b = 25 back into a = 45 - b, we get a = 20.

In Tim's case: P = $500, r = 0.10, n = 1, and t = 2. Calculating Tim's total amount after 2 years: A = $500(1 + 0.10/1)^(1*2) = $500(1.10)^2 = $605. The interest earned by Tim in the first 2 years is $605 - $500 = $105. Similarly, for Lana: P = $1000, r = 0.05, n = 1, and t = 2. Lana's total amount after 2 years: A = $1000(1 + 0.05/1)^(1*2) = $1000(1.05)^2 = $1102.5. The interest earned by Lana in the first 2 years is $1102.5 - $1000 = $102.5.

A Vicsek fractal starts with a square grid. In order 0, there is just a single square, which has 4 line segments.

For order 1, each line segment of the order 0 fractal is replaced by a smaller copy of the entire fractal. Since there are 4 line segments in the order 0 fractal, and each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller line segments, there are 4 * 4 = 16 line segments in the order 1 fractal.

For order 2, each line segment of the order 1 fractal is replaced by a smaller copy of the entire fractal. Since there are 16 line segments in the order 1 fractal, and each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller line segments, there are 16 * 4 = 64 line segments in the order 2 fractal.

For order 3, each line segment of the order 2 fractal is replaced by a smaller copy of the entire fractal. Since there are 64 line segments in the order 2 fractal, and each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller line segments, there are 64 * 4 = 256 line segments in the order 3 fractal.

Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we add 225 to both sides to get 2ab - 15a - 15b + 225 = 225. This can be factored as (2a - 15)(2b - 15) = 225. The positive divisors of 225 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 25, 45, 75, 225. By setting 2a - 15 equal to each of these divisors and solving for a, we can find the corresponding b values.

Given that the area of the farm is 1200 m^2 and the short side is 30 m long. First, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangular farm. Let the long side of the farm be L meters. Since the area of a rectangle is given by length x width, we have L x 30 = 1200. Solving for L, we get L = 40 m. Now, to calculate the total length of fencing needed, we sum the lengths of the long side, short side, and the diagonal. The total length of fencing is L + 30 + √(L^2 + 30^2). Substituting the values, the total length of fencing is 40 + 30 + √(40^2 + 30^2) = 70 + √(1600 + 900) = 70 + √2500 = 70 + 50 = 120 m. Given that the cost of fencing is Rs.10 per meter, the total cost of fencing the farm is 120 x 10 = Rs. 1200. Therefore, the job would cost Rs. 1200. The answer is (B) 1200.",math

Now, let the 21 women take x days of 6 hours each to do the work. So, the work done by 21 women in 1 day = 1/(x*6). Since the amount of work done is the same, we can equate the work done by men and women: 1/168 = 1/(x*6)*21.

The speed of the man in still water is 9.5 kmph and the speed of the current is 8.5 kmph. The effective speed when rowing downstream is the sum of the man's speed and the speed of the current, which is 9.5 + 8.5 = 18 kmph.

Since 3 women do as much work as 2 men, the work done by 21 women in x days is equivalent to the work done by 21 * 3 = 63 women in 21 days. Now, since 15 men take 21 days of 8 hours each to do the work, the total work done by the men in 1 day is 15 * 21 / 168 = 1/2. Therefore, 63 women can do the work in 1/2 days. If 63 women can do the work in 1/2 days, then 21 women can do the work in 63 / 21 = 3 days. However, this is for 8-hour days. To find the number of days of 6 hours each, we use the concept of 'Men-Day-Units'. The work is constant and can be calculated as (Number of men) * (Number of days) * (Number of hours per day). Equating the amount of work done by the men and women, we get 15 * 21 * 8 = 21 * x * 6. Solving for x, we find x = 40.5. Therefore, 21 women would take 40.5 days of 6 hours each to do the same work.

The transfer function H(s) is given by: H(s) = (7s^2 + 2s + 5) / (s^3 + 6s^2 + 11s + 6) First, let's find the poles by setting the denominator equal to zero: s^3 + 6s^2 + 11s + 6 = 0 This is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can try factoring the equation to see if it simplifies: (s + 1)(s^2 + 5s + 6) = 0 Now, we can see that one of the poles is s = -1. The remaining quadratic equation can be factored further: (s + 1)(s + 2)(s + 3) = 0 So, the poles of the transfer function are s = -1, s = -2, and s = -3. Now, let's find the zeros of the transfer function by setting the numerator equal to zero: 7s^2 + 2s + 5 = 0 This is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find its roots: s = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a s = (-2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(7)(5))) / (2 * 7) Since the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, the zeros are complex conjugates: s = -1/7 ± (2/7)i Now that we have the poles and zeros of the transfer function, we can determine the stability of the system.

A Vicsek fractal starts with a square grid. In order 0, there is just a single square, which has 4 line segments. For order 1, each line segment of the order 0 fractal is replaced by a smaller copy of the entire fractal. Since there are 4 line segments in the order 0 fractal, and each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller line segments, there are 4 * 4 = 16 line segments in the order 1 fractal. For order 2, each line segment of the order 1 fractal is replaced by a smaller copy of the entire fractal.

So, in 1 hour, 1 typist can type 3 * 60 = 180 letters. Since there are 30 typists working at the same rate, they will complete 30 * 180 = 5400 letters in 1 hour. The answer is (E) 310.",math
774,"Solve the following system of equations: 
2x + y = 5 
3x - y = 7. Find the values of x and y.","Let's solve the problem step by step. First, let's calculate the length of the long side of the rectangular farm. We know that the area of the farm is 1200 m^2 and the short side is 30 m long. So, we can calculate the length of the long side using the formula for the area of a rectangle: length x width = area. Therefore, length x 30 = 1200, which gives us the length as 40 m. Now, let's calculate the length of the diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem: diagonal^2 = length^2 + width^2. Substituting the values, we get diagonal^2 = 40^2 + 30^2 = 1600 + 900 = 2500. Taking the square root on both sides gives us the length of the diagonal as 50 m. Now, let's calculate the total length of fencing required: 2 x (long side) + 2 x (short side) + diagonal = 2 x 40 + 2 x 30 + 50 = 80 + 60 + 50 = 190 m. Given that the cost of fencing is Rs.10 per meter, the total cost of the job would be 190 x 10 = Rs. 1900. Therefore, the cost of the job is Rs. 1900.

775,"In a group of 50 students, 25 play football, 18 play basketball, and 10 play both football and basketball. How many students in the group do not play either football or basketball?","To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x - 4, we first need to find the second derivative of the function and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.

First, let's find the first derivative of f(x):

f'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x - 4)
f'(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12

Now, let's find the second derivative of f(x):

f''(x) = d/dx (6x^2 - 18x + 12)
f''(x) = 12x - 18

To find the inflection points, we need to set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for x:

12x - 18 = 0
12x = 18
x = 18/12
x = 3/2

So, there is one inflection point at x = 3/2. To find the corresponding y-value, we plug this value back into the original function:

f(3/2) = 2(3/2)^3 - 9(3/2)^2 + 12(3/2) - 4
f(3/2) = 2(27/8) - 9(9/4) + 18 - 4
f(3/2) = 27/4 - 81/4 + 14
f(3/2) = -54/4 + 14
f(3/2) = -27/2 + 14
f(3/2) = -1/2

Thus, the inflection point is at (3/2, -1/2).",math

Given that 15 men can complete a piece of work in 21 days of 8 hours each, this means the total work is equivalent to 15 * 21 * 8 = 2520 hours of work. Since 3 women do as much work as 2 men, the ratio of work done by a woman to a man is 2:3. Therefore, the work ratio of a man to a woman is 3:2. This implies that 15 men are equivalent to 10 women in terms of the work completed. Hence, 10 women can complete the work in the same amount of time as 15 men, which is 21 days of 8 hours each. Now, to find how many days of 6 hours each 21 women would take to do the same work, we can set up a proportion: (10 women) : (21 women) = (21 days of 8 hours each) : x days of 6 hours each.

It is a population-based optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. Here's a simple implementation of PSO to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 5: 1. Initialize the parameters: - Number of particles: n = 30 - Number of iterations: max_iter = 100 - Inertia weight: w = 0.7 - Cognitive acceleration coefficient: c1 = 1.5 - Social acceleration coefficient: c2 = 1.5 - Search space limits: x_min = -10, x_max = 10 2. Initialize the particles' positions and velocities randomly within the search space limits. 3. Calculate the fitness of each particle using the function f(x). 4. Update each particle's personal best position (pbest) and the global best position (gbest) if the current position has a better fitness. 5. For each iteration: a. Update the velocity of each particle using the following equation: v_i = w * v_i + c1 * rand() * (pbest_i - x_i) + c2 * rand() * (gbest - x_i) b. Update the position of each particle using the equation: x_i = x_i + v_i c. Calculate the fitness of each particle using the function f(x). d. Update each particle's personal best position (pbest) and the global best position (gbest) if the current position has a better fitness. e. Repeat steps a to d until the maximum number of iterations is reached. 6. The minimum value of the function f(x) is the fitness of the global best position (gbest). By running the PSO algorithm with the given parameters, we can find an approximate minimum value for the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 5. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm. However, the true minimum value of the function can be found analytically by completing the square or using calculus. In this case, the minimum value is 4, which occurs at x = -1.",math

Setting up the equation: T/60 = (T - 10)/45 Solving for T, we get T = 600. When the leak drains out 20 liters per day, the effective supply rate becomes (T - 20)/x liters per day. Setting up the equation: T/60 = (T - 20)/x Substituting T = 600, we get 600/60 = (600 - 20)/x Solving for x, we get x = 48. So, the supply will last for 48 days if the leak drains out 20 liters per day.",math
