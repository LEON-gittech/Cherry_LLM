4,"Build a REST API endpoint that accepts POST requests with JSON data to create new user accounts. The API should validate the data and store it in a database. Table Name: 'Users' Columns: 'UserId', 'Username', 'Email', 'Password'","To build a REST API endpoint that accepts POST requests with JSON data to create new user accounts and store it in a database, you would typically need to use a web framework such as Flask or Django in Python, or Express in Node.js. Here is a general outline of how you can achieve this:

1. Set up your web framework and create a route that accepts POST requests at a specific endpoint (e.g., '/create-user').

2. Define a function that handles the POST requests to this endpoint. This function will parse the JSON data from the request and extract the 'Username', 'Email', and 'Password' fields.

3. Validate the data extracted from the JSON request to ensure it meets the required criteria (e.g., checking if the email is valid, password is strong, etc.). You can use libraries like Flask-RESTful or Django REST framework for data validation.

4. Once the data is validated, establish a connection to your database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and execute an INSERT query to store the new user account in the 'Users' table. Make sure to securely hash the password before storing it.

5. Return a success response with a 201 status code if the user account is created successfully, or an error response with a 400 status code if there are validation errors or issues with storing the data.

Remember to handle exceptions, implement security measures (e.g., input sanitation, parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection), and consider implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing this endpoint."
5,"Design a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers, excluding any negative numbers.","def calculate_average(numbers):
